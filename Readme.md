### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To analyze the relation between the outcome of a theater campaign and the date the campaign was launched I created a pivot table from the master data filtered to contain only data from theater campaigns for all years in the database.  The sum of the different outcomes were shown per month in rows.

From this pivot table I produced a linechart with the sum of each of the possible outcomes on the y-axis and the month the campaign was launched on the x-axis:



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
